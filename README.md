# Mars Weather Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes weather data collected from NASA's Curiosity Rover on Mars. The dataset includes information on daily minimum temperatures, atmospheric pressure, and seasonal variations on the Red Planet. The analysis helps estimate the length of a Martian year, identify temperature trends, and study pressure fluctuations.

## Dataset Information
The dataset consists of the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each record.

terrestrial_date: Earth date corresponding to the Martian sol.

sol: Martian day (Sol) since Curiosity’s landing.

ls: Solar Longitude, indicating the season on Mars.

month: The Martian month (1-12).

min_temp: Minimum recorded temperature (°C).

pressure: Atmospheric pressure (Pa).

## Key Analyses Performed

1. Number of Months on Mars

The dataset confirms that Mars has 12 months, similar to Earth, but they vary in length due to Mars' elliptical orbit.

2. Number of Martian Days (Sols) Recorded

The dataset contains sol-based data, allowing us to track seasonal changes over time.

3. Coldest and Warmest Months

Coldest month: Month 3 (corresponding to Martian winter).

Warmest month: Month 9 (corresponding to Martian summer).

Temperature fluctuations align with the Martian seasonal cycle.

4. Atmospheric Pressure Analysis

Lowest atmospheric pressure: Month 6 (likely due to the thinning atmosphere in summer).

Highest atmospheric pressure: Month 9 (thicker atmosphere in winter).

5. Length of a Martian Year

By analyzing cyclic temperature variations, we estimate that a Martian year is approximately 670 Earth days long.

## Conclusion

Mars exhibits distinct seasonal changes, impacting both temperature and atmospheric pressure. This dataset provides valuable insights into the Martian climate, helping researchers understand the environmental conditions Curiosity encounters daily.
